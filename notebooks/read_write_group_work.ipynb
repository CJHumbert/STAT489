    "# Reading and Writing Tables Group Work\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will read, merge, filter, and reduce tables about baseball to answer a number of questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Here are the rules**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use `with_iter` from `more_itertools` combined with `csv.reader` to read tables.\n",
    "2. Use a `with` statement and the `consume(side_effects(print_func,seq))` pattern to write files.\n",
    "3. Write `lambda` expressions involving list comprehensions to process the tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hints**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start by inspecting the files and noting the necessary columns.\n",
    "2. Join the needed information into a single table.\n",
    "3. Use the keys (playerID, teamID, etc.) to join the rows of tables.\n",
    "4. Try to filter whenever possible to shorten tables.\n",
    "5. Join and reduce the tables in separate steps.\n",
    "6. Don't be afraid to work incrementally, applying little changes one at a time.  You can always compose your functions later."
